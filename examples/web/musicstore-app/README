This directory contains the RDC based JSPs for the MusicStore sample
application.

The starting point for this application is:
./voice/mainmenu.do

This application implements a VUI for a music store application,
allowing users to browse through the music albums available on Amazon,
assemble a shopping cart and then retrieve the shopping cart on the
Amazon web site via ../getcart.jsp
This application uses the Amazon Web Services, and hence, a real backend.

#####
YOU NEED A AMAZON WEB SERVICES SUBSCRIPTION ID 
TO TRY OUT THIS SAMPLE APPLICATION.

This was the URI for AWS when this application was authored:
http://www.amazon.com/gp/aws/landing.html
Click on "Register for AWS" on the top left.

ONCE YOU GET THE ID, UPDATE THE ../WEB-INF/web.xml
FILE SUCH THAT THE <context-param> with name
com.amazon.ecs.SubscriptionId
CONTAINS YOUR ID AS THE <param-value>
#####


This is the overall control flow:
1) Browse - Asks user for the category and/or genre of the type of
   music the user is interested in. Categories include types such as
   Top Sellers, New Releases etc. Genres include Rock, Country, Dance
   etc.
2) Select / list similar - Once a list of top 10 results matching
   the query in (1) are presented to the user, the user can select
   one of these and carry out further interaction such as getting
   the album description and looking for similar music albums.
3) Add to cart - The user can add music albums of interest to the user's
   shopping cart. This is a shopping cart created at Amazon using the
   web services API. Steps (1) through (3) can be repeated as many times
   as needed.
4) Check out - The user is provided with cart ID. The user then uses a
   web/HTML browser to visit ../getcart.jsp, and upon using the above
   cart ID in the form on the subsequent web page, is redirected to the
   Amazon web site where the user can complete the transaction and buy
   the items added via the VUI to the user's shopping cart.
